Here are my set of sample programs which are discussed in my series of YouTube video episodes. The objective of this research is to assess the system performance overheads of user-space sockets (in this case UDP sockets) vs Message queues. So that this can be used as a basis to access a server/device potential as a Linux based network appliance (can be a Firewall device, VPN, WAN Optimization, and so on).
